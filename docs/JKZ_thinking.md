Meditation: It’s Not What You Think
===================================

By Jon Kabat-Zinn, Ph.D.

It might be good to clarify a few common
misunderstandings about meditation right off the
bat. First, meditation is best thought of as a way of
being, rather than a technique or a collection of
techniques.

I'll say it again.

Meditation is a way of being, not a technique.
This doesn't mean that there aren't methods
and techniques associated with meditation practice.

There are. In fact, there are hundreds of them,
and we will be making good use of some of them.
But without understanding that all techniques are
orienting vehicles pointing at ways of being, ways
of being in relationship to the present moment and
to one's own mind and one's own experience, we
can easily get lost in techniques and in our
misguided but entirely understandable attempts to
use them to get somewhere else and experience
some special result or state that we think is the goal
of it all…

Second, meditation is not relaxation spelled
differently. Perhaps I should say that again as well:
Meditation is not relaxation spelled differently.

That doesn't mean that meditation is not
frequently accompanied by profound states of
relaxation and by deep feelings of wellbeing. Of
course it is, or can be, sometimes. But mindfulness
meditation is the embrace of any and all mind
states in awareness, without preferring one to
another. From the point of view of mindfulness
practice, pain or anguish, or for that matter
boredom or impatience or frustration or anxiety or
tension in the body are all equally valid objects of
our attention if we find them arising in the present
moment, each a rich opportunity for insight and
learning, and potentially, for liberation, rather than
signs that our meditation practice is not
"succeeding" because we are not feeling relaxed or
experiencing bliss in some moment.

We might say that meditation is really a way of
being appropriate to the circumstances one finds
oneself in, in any and every moment. If we are
caught up in the preoccupations of our own mind,
in that moment we cannot be present in an
appropriate way or perhaps at all. We will bring an
agenda of some kind to whatever we say or do or
think, even if we don't know it…

For meditation, and especially mindfulness
meditation, is not the throwing of a switch and
catapulting yourself anywhere, nor is it entertaining
certain thoughts and getting rid of others. Nor is it
making your mind blank or willing yourself to be
peaceful or relaxed. It is really an inward gesture
that inclines the heart and mind (seen as one
seamless whole) toward a full-spectrum awareness
of the present moment just as it is, accepting
whatever is happening simply because it is already
happening…

Meditation is not about trying to get anywhere
else. It is about allowing yourself to be exactly
where you are and as you are, and for the world to
be exactly as it is in this moment as well. This is not
so easy, since there is always something that we
can rightly find fault with if we stay inside our
thinking. And so there tends to be great resistance
on the part of the mind and body to settle into
things just as they are, even for a moment. That
resistance to what is may be even more
compounded if we are meditating because we hope
that by doing so, we can effect change, make things
different, improve our own lives, and contribute to
improving the lot of the world…

So, from the point of view of awareness, any
state of mind is a meditative state. Anger or
sadness is just as interesting and useful and valid
to look into as enthusiasm or delight, and far more
valuable than a blank mind, a mind that is
insensate, out of touch.
Anger, fear, terror,
sadness, resentment, impatience, enthusiasm,
delight, confusion, disgust, contempt, envy, rage,
lust, even dullness, doubt, and torpor, in fact all
mind states and body states are occasions to know
ourselves better if we can stop, look, and listen, in
other words, if we can come to our senses and be
intimate with what presents itself in awareness in
any and every moment. The astonishing thing, so
counterintuitive, is that nothing else needs to
happen. We can give up trying to make something
special occur. In letting go of wanting something
special to occur, maybe we can realize that
something very special is already occurring, and is
always occurring, namely life emerging in each
moment as awareness itself.
