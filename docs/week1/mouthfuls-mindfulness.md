Mouthfuls of Mindfulness
========================
by Jan Chozen Bays

_Overeat, undereat, or just feel conflicted about how you
eat? Mindfulness practice, says physician Jan Chozen
Bays, can help you have a healthy and joyful relationship
with food._

Mindful eating is not directed by charts,
tables, pyramids, or scales. It is not dictated by an
expert. It is directed by your own inner
experiences, moment by moment. Your
experience is unique. Therefore you are the
expert. In the process of learning to eat mindfully,
we replace self-criticism with self-nurturing,
anxiety with curiosity, and shame with respect for
your own inner wisdom.

Let’s take a typical experience. On the way
home from work Sally thinks with dread about the
talk she needs to work on for a big conference.
Before starting to work on the speech, however,
she decides to relax and watch a few minutes of
TV. She sits down with a bag of chips. At first she
eats onlya few, but as the show gets more
dramatic, she eats faster and faster. When the
show ends she looks down and realizes she’s eaten
the entire bag. She scolds herself for wasting time
and for eating junk food. “Too much salt and fat!
No dinner for you!” Engrossed in the drama on
the screen, covering up her anxiety about
procrastinating, she ignored what was happening
in her mind, heart, mouth, and stomach. She ate
unconsciously. She ate to go unconscious. She
goes to bed unnourished in body or heart and with
her mind still anxious about the talk.

The next time this happens she decides to eat
chips but to try eating them mindfully. First she
checks in with her mind. She finds her mind is
worried about an article she promised to write.
Her mind says she needs to get started on it tonight.
She checks in with her heart and finds she is
feeling a little lonely because her husband is out
of town. She checks in with her stomach and body
and discovers she is both hungry and tired. She
needs some nurturing. The only one at home to do
it is herself.

### Throwing a Small Party
She decides to treat herself to a small chip
party. (Remember, mindful eating gives us
permission to play with our food.) She takes
twenty chips out of the bag and arranges them on
a plate. She looks at their color and shape. She
eats one chip, savoring its flavor. She pauses, then
eats another. There is no judgment, no right or
wrong. She is simply seeing the shades of tan and
brown on each curved surface, tasting the tang of
salt, hearing the crunch of each bite, feeling the
crisp texture melt into softness. She ponders how
these chips arrived on her plate, aware of the sun,
the soil, the rain, the potato farmer, the workers at
the chip factory, the delivery truck driver, the
grocer who stocked the shelves and sold them to
her.

With little pauses between each chip, it takes
ten minutes for the chip party. When she finishes,
she checks in with her body to find out if any part
of it is still hungry.

She finds her mouth and cells are thirsty, so
she gets a drink of orange juice. Her body is also
saying it needs some protein and something green,
so she makes a cheese omelet and a spinach salad.
After eating she checks in again with her mind,
body, and heart. The heart and body feel
nourished but the mind is still tired. She decides to
go to bed and work on the talk first thing in the
morning, when the mind and body will be rested.
She is still feeling lonely, although less so within
the awareness of all the beings whose life energy
brought her the chips, eggs, cheese, and greens.
She decides to call her husband to say good night.
She goes to bed with body, mind, and heart at ease
and sleeps soundly.

Mindful eating is a way to rediscover one of
the most pleasurable things we do as human
beings. It also is a path to uncovering many
wonderful activities going on right under our
noses and within our own bodies. Mindful eating
has the unexpected benefit of helping us tap into
our body’s natural wisdom and our heart’s natural
capacity for openness and gratitude. We ask
ourselves questions like:

_Am I hungry?_

_Where do I feel hunger?_

_What part of me is hungry?_

_What do I really crave?_

_What am I tasting just now?_

These are very simple questions, but we
seldom pose them.

### Mindfulness Is the Best Flavoring
As I write this I am eating a lemon tart that a
friend gave to me. After writing for a few hours
I’m readyto reward myself with a tart. The first
bite is delicious. Creamy, sweet-sour, melting.
When I take the second bite, I think about what to
write next. The flavor in my mouth decreases. I
take another bite and get up to sharpen a pencil.
As I walk, I notice I am chewing, but there is
almost no lemon flavor in this third bite. I sit
down, get to work, and wait a few minutes.

Then I take a fourth bite, fully focused on the
smells, tastes, and touch sensations in my mouth.
Delicious, again! I discover, all over again (I’m a
slow learner) that the only way to keep that “first
bite” experience, to honor the gift my friend gave
me, is to eat slowly, with long pauses between
bites. If I do anything else while I’m eating—if I
talk, walk, write, or even think—the flavor diminishes
or disappears. The life is drained from my
beautiful tart. I could be eating the cardboard box.

Here’s the humorous part. I stopped tasting the
lemon tart because I was thinking. About what?
Mindful eating! Discovering that, I grin. To be a
human being is both pitiful and funny.

Why can’t I think, walk, and be aware of the
taste of the tart at the same time? I can’t do all
these at once because the mind has two distinct
functions, thinking and awareness. When the
thinking is turned up, the awareness is turned
down. When the thinking function is going full
throttle, we can eat an entire meal, an entire cake,
an entire carton of ice cream, and not taste more
than a bite or two. When we don’t taste, we can
end up stuffed to the gills but feeling completely
unsatisfied. This is because the mind and mouth
weren’t present, weren’t tasting or enjoying, as we
ate. The stomach became full but the mind and
mouth were unfulfilled and continued calling for
us to eat.

If we don’t feel satisfied, we’ll begin to look
around for something more or something different
to eat. Everyone has had the experience of roaming
the kitchen, opening cupboards and doors,
looking vainly for something, anything, to satisfy.
The only thing that will cure this, a fundamental
kind of hunger, is to sit down and be, even for a
few minutes, wholly present.

If we eat and stay connected with our experience
and with the people who grew and cooked
the food, who served the food, and who eat alongside
us, we will feel most satisfied, even with a
meager meal. This is the gift of mindful eating, to
restore our sense of satisfaction no matter what we
are or are not eating.
