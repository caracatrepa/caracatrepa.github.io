What Would It Take for You to Be Still?
=======================================

_How can you learn to slow down time, quiet the mental
chatter, and savor life's breezes? With mindfulness, one
snowcapped mountain meditation at a time._

When I decided to take up meditation, it seemed
so easy - slip on a pair of yoga pants, force your legs
into half lotus, and "om" your way to serenity and
bliss. Forget that my hips are too tight for even a
quarter of a lotus, or that the last time I felt truly
serene, prescription drugs were involved. I had to try
it - I needed to find a way to slow things down.

Lately it's felt like my life is on warp speed.
Weekends blur into months; months blur into
seasons. I eat fast, I talk fast, I walk fast - I swear I
even sleep fast. And I find it almost impossible to sit
still. All that research showing that fidgeting burns
tons of calories is good news for me. I may get a lot
done, but smell the roses? I'm not even getting a
passing whiff.

We've all had the experience of sensing time
decelerate naturally when we're not so thrilled about
what we're doing (think torturous spinning class or
hour-long "synergy workshop" at the office). As my
dear grandmother would have said, it takes only one
colonoscopy to prove that time is relative. But what
about the more enjoyable times in life? I hoped that
practicing the popular and proven type of meditation
called mindfulness - which focuses on bringing
awareness to the present moment - might help me
slow those times down as well.

Ready to begin, I went straight to the source: Jon
Kabat-Zinn, PhD, the founder of the Stress Reduction
Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical
School. Kabat-Zinn is the creator of an eight-week
course called Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction
(MBSR), which he began teaching in 1979 and which
is now the largest and oldest meditation-based
clinical program in the world. (Kabat-Zinn's program
is taught at the University of Massachusetts, but you
can find other MBSR courses around the country.)

There are many types of meditation, so why did I
opt for MBSR? Two reasons. First, I liked that it's
taught in a secular context; even though it's based on
some core principles of Buddhism, I didn't need any
background knowledge to begin. Second, as someone
who wants to understand why I'm doing something -
especially when that thing is challenging - I liked the
idea that there was scientific proof of its
effectiveness. (Because its curriculum is so
consistent, it's one of the most studied forms of
meditation in the world.)

Kabat-Zinn suggested I start at home by
practicing one or two guided 20- to 45-minute
exercises six days a week (yes, even meditators need
a day off). After we talked about my reason for
wanting to meditate - Kabat-Zinn says it's important
to identify your motivation before you begin, or
you'll be tempted to give up - he recommended that I
kick off my practice with what he thought would be
an easy starting point: a visualization called the
mountain meditation. I loaded my iPod with the 20-
minute exercise, which requires you to sit erect on the
floor or a chair, close your eyes, and observe your
breathing as you imagine a mountain. First, you
notice small details - the trees that cover its slopes,
perhaps a dollop of snow at the peak - and eventually
you try to imagine becoming the mountain itself,
feeling its strength and solidity and noticing that even
when it's battered by the wind or drenched with rain,its rock-hard interior remains stable and calm.
(Meditation teachers love metaphors.)

The goal of the mountain meditation is the same
as with every other mindfulness technique - whether
you're focusing on an image, your breath, or
sensations in your body, you're trying to coax your
mind into what Kabat-Zinn calls a state of nondoing.
That's not the same as doing nothing. Rather, it means
you're not thinking about your grocery list or the
conversation you had with a friend last night or the
unfinished report sitting on your desk at work. Nor
are you trying to force your mind to go blank or
conjure up any special feelings. You're concentrating
on just one thing, experiencing each moment as it
happens, and trying to be - if I might quote Van Halen
- right here, right now.

What does experiencing the moment have to do
with imagining yourself as a mountain? Think of it as
strength training. By learning to quiet your mind's
chatter and concentrate solely on your mental
Rockies, you're gaining the focus necessary to stay
present when you're not actively meditating. The
point is to avoid cruising through life on autopilot, so
wrapped up in your daily routine that you don't notice
the world around you. "Mindfulness is about living
your life as if it really mattered," says Kabat-Zinn. "If
you're not mentally present in the small moments,
you could be missing half your life."

If this nondoing sounds easy, take 20 minutes and
try the mountain exercise yourself. It won't be long
before your mountain - which in my case was less
Mount Everest and more like the label on an Evian
bottle - drifts away and is replaced by a game of free
association: A mountain reminds you of skiing,
which reminds you of a family vacation, which
reminds you of the weekend, which reminds you that
a friend invited you to dinner on Saturday, which
reminds you that you never got back to her and that
maybe you should be writing her an e-mail instead of
sitting on the floor pretending you're a mountain -
which reminds you that you're supposed to be sitting
on the floor pretending you're a mountain, which
makes you mad at yourself for letting your mind
wander. And then - bam. Not only are you no longer
cultivating intimacy with the present moment, you're
committing one of mindfulness's biggest faux pas:
beating yourself up for getting distracted. (As soon as
you start making judgments, you're out of the
moment.) Kabat-Zinn didn't say this explicitly, but
I'm pretty sure that mindfulness exercises should not
include obscenities.

After a few days pretending to be a mountain
(and, in a different exercise, a lake), it became clear
that I am not a visual person. Unable to picture a
mountain in the first place, let alone concentrate on it
for 20 minutes, I compensated by imagining my
breath flowing up my body and rushing out the top of
my head - which worked better, until I realized I'd
turned my calm snowy peak into a volcano. So with
Kabat-Zinn's blessing, I moved on to a meditation
that I hoped might come more naturally to me: the
body scan. One of the key exercises in the MBSR
course, it's 45 minutes of carefully guiding your
attention up and down your body, trying to home in
on the sensations in each isolated part. The exercise
begins with your left big toe and, unfortunately in my
case, it often ends there - as Kabat-Zinn likes to point
out, while it's very difficult to learn to "fall awake"
(become connected to the present moment), it's quite
easy, when meditating, to fall asleep.

Still, I stuck with it. I liked the challenge of trying
to harness my mind, and I was intrigued by studies
showing that MBSR does even more than that. In
2003, for example, scientists from the University of
Wisconsin-Madison examined a group that included
alumni of Kabat-Zinn's eight-week course, and found
that when they received flu shots, the meditators'
immune systems produced more antibodies in
response to the vaccine than did the non-meditators'.
In a 1998 University of Massachusetts study, patients
with psoriasis who meditated while receiving
ultraviolet treatments for their skin healed four times
faster than the control group - regardless of whether
they had any previous meditation training.
Researchers don't yet understand all the details of
why changes like these occur, but one possible
explanation is that this type of meditation reduces
stress and helps people develop a more positive
outlook, both of which have been shown to
strengthen the body's immune system.

What's more, according to researcher Norman
Farb, who studies meditation and experimental
psychology at the University of Toronto, such
mindfulness-based meditation can actually change
the way you use your brain. As Farb explains it, most
of the time, we (by which I mean your average
nonmeditating American) respond to new stimuli and
experiences automatically, based on how we think
they'll affect us. A traffic jam isn't just cars; it's a
problem that will make us late for dinner - so when
we see a red wall of taillights in front of us, we
become stressed-out. A pair of sneakers strewn in the
doorway aren't just discarded shoes; they're anannoying obstacle. So when we trip over them, we
(by which I mean your average non-meditating
Catherine) get irritated with our husbands. In other
words, we don't just experience, we evaluate - and
then respond without thinking (clogged highway =
extra minutes stuck in the car = misery).

Typically this type of narrative processing takes
place in the medial prefrontal cortex, an area of the
brain behind the center of your forehead that
coordinates complex behaviors and thoughts. (It's
also the part of the brain that's being used when your
mind starts to wander.) While it's possible to stifle
this default way of thinking, trying to do so is like
forcing yourself to go to the gym after years of
inactivity - sure, you could fight your way through a
step aerobics class if you had to, but wouldn't it be
nicer to just eat Doritos on the couch?

Farb has found that people who have completed
the eight-week MBSR training, on the other hand, are
able to activate an entirely different part of the brain
- the insula. Located deep inside your gray matter, the
insula informs you of what's happening in the present
moment without connecting the experience to a
specific emotion. When you're thinking this way, a
traffic jam doesn't seem like a problem; it's simply a
bunch of cars on the road.

The point of meditation is not to stop you from
having an emotional response to what's happening in
your life - it's to avoid responding purely out of habit.
Every situation, if you think about it, is an invitation
for you to react in a certain way, but being mindful
gives you the chance to decide how to RSVP. Does
the sight of bumper-to-bumper traffic mean you have
to get stressed-out? Or could you think of those extra
20 minutes as a chance to listen to a favorite CD?
(Judging from the increase in my heart rate just from
typing "bumper-to-bumper," I've got work to do.) Is
it really worth getting angry at my husband over those
misplaced sneakers? Or would I rather be thankful for
the fact that he folded the laundry? On the flip side,
if it turns out you do want to say yes to the invitation
- by feeling happy about a new promotion, for
example - you can use mindfulness to savor the
moment more fully. It doesn't matter whether the
experience is good or bad; mindfulness reminds you
that when it comes to your reactions, you're the one
in charge.

Still, Kabat-Zinn had warned me not to expect
that anything magical would happen while I was
meditating, or even that it would always feel
enjoyable - a caveat that I appreciated whenever I
grew irritable or uncomfortable, or found myself
counting down the seconds during my daily practice.
He also pointed out that meditation is not a quick fix;
becoming - and staying - mindful is a lifelong
process.

But as I continued experimenting each day with
the guided exercises, I was happy to find that they did
become easier. I developed some tricks for everyday
life, too - like taking a few slow, conscious breaths to
bring my attention back to the present moment, or
choosing a particular sense to focus on. And I tried
not to get annoyed when my mind wandered. As
Kabat-Zinn says, stopping your brain from thinking
would be like stopping the ocean's waves. It's more
productive to simply observe the thoughts without
getting carried away by them - and try to tap into the
calm that exists beneath the surface.

By training myself to stay focused during the
exercises, I've also gotten better at staying present
when I'm not actively meditating. As a result, I've
discovered that each day is dense with experiences -
the breeze against my skin, the play of light on the
grass, the sound of my husband's laugh - and if I want
to stretch out time, all I need to do is notice them.
When I find my mind racing ahead or am tempted to
skip my daily practice, I remember another of Kabat-
Zinn's sayings that affirms why this is an experiment
I want to continue: Both figuratively and literally, we
only have moments to live.
