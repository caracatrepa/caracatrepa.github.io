Why We Find It Hard to Meditate
===============================

Ed and Deb Shapiro explore common reasons and obstacles.

What is it about something as simple as sitting
still and watching our breath that evokes panic,
fear, and even hostility? No matter how many
reports there are proving the mental, emotional,
and physical value of being quiet, there seems to be
an even greater number who refuse to give it a try.

Meditation can certainly be challenging, and
even more so if we are uncertain as to why we are
doing it. It can seem very odd to sit there just
listening to the incessant chatter in our head, and
we easily get bored if we do nothing for too long,
even if it’s only 10 minutes.

After years of hearing a plethora of reasons
why people find it hard to meditate, we have
whittled it down to just a few:

### I’m too busy, I don’t have the time.
Which can certainly be true if you have young
children and a full-time job, and all that these
entail. However, we are only talking about maybe
10 minutes a day. Most of us spend more time than
that reading the newspaper or idly surfing the web.
It only appears like we don’t have the time because
we usually fill every moment with activity and
never press the pause button.

### I find it really uncomfortable to sit still for too long.
If you are trying to sit cross-legged on the floor
then, yes, it will get uncomfortable. But you can sit
upright in a firm and comfortable chair instead. Or,
you can do walking meditation, or yoga, or tai chi.
Moving meditation can be just as beneficial as
sitting.

### My mind won’t stop thinking.
_I can’t relax. I
can’t meditate. I just can’t! My mind will not get
quiet; it flies all over the place! My thoughts are
driving me mad! I’m trying to get away from
myself, not look inside._ Sound familiar?

Surprisingly enough, trying to stop your mind
from thinking is like trying to stop the wind – it’s
impossible. In the Eastern teaching the mind is
described as being like a drunken monkey bitten by
a scorpion because, just as a monkey leaps from
branch to branch, so the mind leaps from one thing
to another, constantly distracted and busy. So,
when you come to sit still and try to quiet your
mind, you find all this manic activity going on and
it seems insanely noisy. It is actually nothing new,
just that now you are becoming aware of it,
whereas before you were immersed in it, unaware
that such chatter was so constant.

This experience of the mind being so busy is
very normal. Someone once estimated that in any
one thirty-minute session of meditation we may
have upward of three hundred thoughts. Years of
busy mind, years of creating and maintaining
dramas, years of stresses and confusion and self-
centeredness, and the mind has no idea how to be
still. Rather, it craves entertainment. It’s not as if
you can suddenly turn it off when you meditate, it
just means you are like everyone else.

### There are too many distractions, it’s too noisy.
Gone are the days when we could disappear
into a cave and be left undisturbed until we
emerged some time later fully enlightened. Instead,
we all have to deal with the sounds and impositions
of the world around us. But – and it’s a big but –
we needn’t let it impose. Cars going by outside?
Fine. Let them go by, but just don’t go with them.
The quiet you are looking for is inside, not outside.
The experience of stillness is accumulative: The
more you sit, then slowly, slowly, the mind becomes quieter, more joyful, despite whatever
distraction there may be.

### I don’t see the benefit.
Unfortunately, this is where you have to take
our word for it. Some people get how beneficial
meditation is after just one session, but most of us
take longer – you might notice a difference after a
week, or maybe two of daily practice. Which
means you have to trust the process enough to hang
in there and keep going, even before you get the
benefits.

Remember, music needs to be played for hours
to get the notes right, while in Japan it can take 12
years to learn how to arrange flowers. Being still
happens in a moment, but it may take some time
before that moment comes—hence the need for
patience.

### I’m no good at this. I never get it right.
Actually, it’s impossible to fail at meditation.
Even if you sit for 20 minutes thinking non-stop
meaningless thoughts, that’s fine. There is no right
or wrong, and there’s no special technique. Deb’s
meditation teacher told her there are as many forms
of meditation as there are people who practice it.
So all you need do is find the way that works for
you (even if you prefer to do it standing on your
head) and keep at it.

The important point is that you make friends
with meditation. It’ll be of no help at all if you feel
you have to meditate, for instance, and then feel
guilty if you miss the allotted time or only do 10
minutes when you had promised to do 30. It is
much better to practice for a just a sort time and to
enjoy what you are doing than to sit there, teeth
gritted, because you’ve been told that only 30 or
even 40 minutes will have any affect. Meditation is
a companion to have throughout life, like an old
friend you turn to when in need of support,
inspiration, and clarity. It is to be enjoyed!

### It’s all just weird New Age hype.
It’s certainly easy to get lost in the array of New
Age promises of eternal happiness but meditation
itself is as old as the hills. More than 2,500 years
ago the Buddha was a dedicated meditator who
tried and tested numerous different ways of
enabling the mind to be quiet. And that’s just one
example. Each religion has its own variation on the
theme, and all stretch back over the centuries. So
nothing new here, and nothing weird.

In other words, meditation is not about forcing
the mind to be absolutely still. Rather, it’s a letting
go of resistance, of whatever may arise: doubt,
worry, uncertainty and feeling inadequate, the
endless dramas, fear and desire. Every time you
find your mind is drifting, daydreaming,
remembering the past or planning ahead, just come
back to now, come back to this moment. All you
need do is pay attention and be with what is.
Nothing else.
