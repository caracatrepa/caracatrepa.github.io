The Brain: How The Brain Rewires Itself
=======================================

_by Sharon Begley_

It was a fairly modest experiment, as these
things go, with volunteers trooping into the lab at
Harvard Medical School to learn and practice a
little five-finger piano exercise. Neuroscientist
Alvaro Pascual-Leone instructed the members of
one group to play as fluidly as they could, trying to
keep to the metronome's 60 beats per minute.
Every day for five days, the volunteers practiced
for two hours. Then they took a test.

At the end of each day's practice session, they
sat beneath a coil of wire that sent a brief magnetic
pulse into the motor cortex of their brain, located
in a strip running from the crown of the head
toward each ear. The so-called transcranial
magnetic-stimulation (TMS) test allows scientists
to infer the function of neurons just beneath the
coil. In the piano players, the TMS mapped how
much of the motor cortex controlled the finger
movements needed for the piano exercise. What
the scientists found was that after a week of
practice, the stretch of motor cortex devoted to
these finger movements took over surrounding
areas like dandelions on a suburban lawn.

The finding was in line with a growing number
of discoveries at the time showing that greater use
of a particular muscle causes the brain to devote
more cortical real estate to it. But Pascual-Leone
did not stop there. He extended the experiment by
having another group of volunteers merely think
about practicing the piano exercise. They played
the simple piece of music in their head, holding
their hands still while imagining how they would
move their fingers. Then they too sat beneath the
TMS coil.

When the scientists compared the TMS data on
the two groups--those who actually tickled the
ivories and those who only imagined doing so-
they glimpsed a revolutionary idea about the brain:
the ability of mere thought to alter the physical
structure and function of our gray matter. For what
the TMS revealed was that the region of motor
cortex that controls the piano-playing fingers also
expanded in the brains of volunteers who imagined
playing the music--just as it had in those who
actually played it.

"Mental practice resulted in a similar
reorganization" of the brain, Pascual-Leone later
wrote. If his results hold for other forms of
movement (and there is no reason to think they
don't), then mentally practicing a golf swing or a
forward pass or a swimming turn could lead to
mastery with less physical practice. Even more
profound, the discovery showed that mental
training had the power to change the physical
structure of the brain.

OVERTHROWING THE DOGMA
----------------------

For decades, the prevailing dogma in
neuroscience was that the adult human brain is
essentially immutable, hardwired, fixed in form
and function, so that by the time we reach
adulthood we are pretty much stuck with what we
have. Yes, it can create (and lose) synapses, the
connections between neurons that encode
memories and learning. And it can suffer injury and
degeneration. But this view held that if genes and
development dictate that one cluster of neurons
will process signals from the eye and another
cluster will move the fingers of the right hand, then
they'll do that and nothing else until the day you
die. There was good reason for lavishly illustrated
brain books to show the function, size and location
of the brain's structures in permanent ink.

The doctrine of the unchanging human brain
has had profound ramifications. For one thing, it
lowered expectations about the value of
rehabilitation for adults who had suffered brain
damage from a stroke or about the possibility of
fixing the pathological wiring that underlies
psychiatric diseases. And it implied that other
brain-based fixities, such as the happiness set point
that, according to a growing body of research, a
person returns to after the deepest tragedy or the
greatest joy, are nearly unalterable.

But research in the past few years has
overthrown the dogma. In its place has come the
realization that the adult brain retains impressive
powers of "neuroplasticity"--the ability to change
its structure and function in response to experience.
These aren't minor tweaks either. Something as
basic as the function of the visual or auditory cortex
can change as a result of a person's experience of
becoming deaf or blind at a young age. Even when
the brain suffers a trauma late in life, it can rezone
itself like a city in a frenzy of urban renewal. If a
stroke knocks out, say, the neighborhood of motor
cortex that moves the right arm, a new technique
called constraint-induced movement therapy can
coax next-door regions to take over the function of
the damaged area. The brain can be rewired.

The first discoveries of neuroplasticity came
from studies of how changes in the messages the
brain receives through the senses can alter its
structure and function. When no transmissions
arrive from the eyes in someone who has been
blind from a young age, for instance, the visual
cortex can learn to hear or feel or even support
verbal memory. When signals from the skin or
muscles bombard the motor cortex or the
somatosensory cortex (which processes touch), the
brain expands the area that is wired to move, say,
the fingers. In this sense, the very structure of our
brain--the relative size of different regions, the
strength of connections between them, even their
functions--reflects the lives we have led. Like sand
on a beach, the brain bears the footprints of the
decisions we have made, the skills we have
learned, the actions we have taken.

SCRATCHING A PHANTOM LIMB
-------------------------

An extreme example of how changes in the
input reaching the brain can alter its structure is the
silence that falls over the somatosensory cortex
after its owner has lost a limb. Soon after a car
crash took Victor Quintero's left arm from just
above the elbow, he told neuroscientist V.S.
Ramachandran of the University of California at
San Diego that he could still feel the missing arm.
Ramachandran decided to investigate. He had
Victor sit still with his eyes closed and lightly
brushed the teenager's left cheek with a cotton
swab.

Where do you feel that? Ramachandran asked.
On his left cheek, Victor answered--and the back
of his missing hand. Ramachandran stroked
another spot on the cheek. Where do you feel that?
On his absent thumb, Victor replied.
Ramachandran touched the skin between Victor's
nose and mouth. His missing index finger was
being brushed, Victor said. A spot just below
Victor's left nostril caused the boy to feel a tingling
on his left pinkie. And when Victor felt an itch in
his phantom hand, scratching his lower face
relieved the itch. In people who have lost a limb,
Ramachandran concluded, the brain reorganizes:
the strip of cortex that processes input from the face
takes over the area that originally received input
from a now missing hand. That's why touching
Victor's face caused brain to "feel" his missing
hand.

Similarly, because the regions of cortex that
handle sensations from the feet abut those that
process sensations from the surface of the genitals,
some people who have lost a leg report feeling
phantom sensations during sex. Ramachandran's
was the first report of a living being knowingly
experiencing the results of his brain rewiring.

THINKING ABOUT THINKING
-----------------------

As scientists probe the limits of neuroplasticity,
they are finding that mind sculpting can occur even
without input from the outside world. The brain can
change as a result of the thoughts we think, as with
Pascual-Leone's virtual piano players. This has
important implications for health: something as
seemingly insubstantial as a thought can affect the
very stuff of the brain, altering neuronal
connections in a way that can treat mental illness
or, perhaps, lead to a greater capacity for empathy
and compassion. It may even dial up the
supposedly immovable happiness set point.
In a series of experiments, for instance, Jeffrey
Schwartz and colleagues at the University of
California, Los Angeles, found that cognitive
behavior therapy (CBT) can quiet activity in the
circuit that underlies obsessive-compulsive
disorder (OCD), just as drugs do. Schwartz had
become intrigued with the therapeutic potential of
mindfulness meditation, the Buddhist practice of
observing one's inner experiences as if they were
happening to someone else.

When OCD patients were plagued by an
obsessive thought, Schwartz instructed them to
think, "My brain is generating another obsessive
thought. Don't I know it is just some garbage
thrown up by a faulty circuit?" After 10 weeks of
mindfulness-based therapy, 12 out of 18 patients
improved significantly. Before-and-after brain
scans showed that activity in the orbital frontal
cortex, the core of the OCD circuit, had fallen
dramatically and in exactly the way that drugs
effective against OCD affect the brain. Schwartz
called it "self-directed neuroplasticity," concluding
that "the mind can change the brain."

The same is true when cognitive techniques are
used to treat depression. Scientists at the University
of Toronto had 14 depressed adults undergo CBT,
which teaches patients to view their own thoughts
differently--to see a failed date, for instance, not as
proof that "I will never be loved" but as a minor
thing that didn't work out. Thirteen other patients
received paroxetine (the generic form of the
antidepressant Paxil). All experienced comparable
improvement after treatment. Then the scientists
scanned the patients' brains. "Our hypothesis was,
if you do well with treatment, your brain will have
changed in the same way no matter which
treatment you received," said Toronto's Zindel
Segal.

But no. Depressed brains responded differently
to the two kinds of treatment--and in a very
interesting way. CBT muted overactivity in the
frontal cortex, the seat of reasoning, logic and
higher thought as well as of endless rumination
about that disastrous date. Paroxetine, by contrast,
raised activity there. On the other hand, CBT raised
activity in the hippocampus of the limbic system,
the brain's emotion center. Paroxetine lowered
activity there. As Toronto's Helen Mayberg
explains, "Cognitive therapy targets the cortex, the
thinking brain, reshaping how you process
information and changing your thinking pattern. It
decreases rumination, and trains the brain to adopt
different thinking circuits." As with Schwartz's
OCD patients, thinking had changed a pattern of
activity--in this case, a pattern associated with
depression--in the brain.

HAPPINESS AND MEDITATION
------------------------

Could thinking about thoughts in a new way
affect not only such pathological brain states as
OCD and depression but also normal activity? To
find out, neuroscientist Richard Davidson of the
University of Wisconsin at Madison turned to
Buddhist monks, the Olympic athletes of mental
training. Some monks have spent more than 10,000
hours of their lives in meditation. Earlier in
Davidson's career, he had found that activity
greater in the left prefrontal cortex than in the right
correlates with a higher baseline level of
contentment. The relative left/right activity came
to be seen as a marker for the happiness set point,
since people tend to return to this level no matter
whether they win the lottery or lose their spouse. If
mental training can alter activity characteristic of
OCD and depression, might meditation or other
forms of mental training, Davidson wondered,
produce changes that underlie enduring happiness
and other positive emotions? "That's the
hypothesis," he says, "that we can think of
emotions, moods and states such as compassion as
trainable mental skills."

With the help and encouragement of the Dalai
Lama, Davidson recruited Buddhist monks to go to
Madison and meditate inside his functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tube while he
measured their brain activity during various mental
states. For comparison, he used undergraduates
who had had no experience with meditation but got
a crash course in the basic techniques. During the
generation of pure compassion, a standard
Buddhist meditation technique, brain regions that
keep track of what is self and what is other became
quieter, the fMRI showed, as if the subjects
-experienced meditators as well as novices--opened
their minds and hearts to others.

More interesting were the differences between
the so-called adepts and the novices. In the former,
there was significantly greater activation in a brain
network linked to empathy and maternal love.
Connections from the frontal regions, so active
during compassion meditation, to the brain's
emotional regions seemed to become stronger with
more years of meditation practice, as if the brain
had forged more robust connections between
thinking and feeling.

But perhaps the most striking difference was in
an area in the left prefrontal cortex--the site of
activity that marks happiness. While the monks
were generating feelings of compassion, activity in
the left prefrontal swamped activity in the right
prefrontal (associated with negative moods) to a
degree never before seen from purely mental
activity. By contrast, the undergraduate controls
showed no such differences between the left and
right prefrontal cortex. This suggests, says
Davidson, that the positive state is a skill that can
be trained.

For the monks as well as the patients with
depression or OCD, the conscious act of thinking
about their thoughts in a particular way rearranged
the brain. The discovery of neuroplasticity, in
particular the power of the mind to change the
brain, is still too new for scientists, let alone the rest
of us, to grasp its full meaning. But even as it offers
new therapies for illnesses of the mind, it promises
something more fundamental: a new understanding
of what it means to be human.
