Mastering Your Own Mind
=======================

_by Katherine Ellison_

_Distracted? Angry? Envious? There's growing evidence
that attention, emotion regulation—even love—are skills
that can be trained through the practice of meditation.
Perhaps it's time for you to become a high-performance
user of your own brain._

Back when my son was 8 years old, he called 911
after I took away his Game Boy. I wish I'd been
studying Buddhism back then, because I probably
could have handled it a lot better. I suspect I wouldn't
have yelled at him while the dispatcher was still
listening. And I bet I wouldn't have been quite so
wracked by dread when the police were questioning
us in separate rooms of the house—at least until I
overheard the other officer ask, "She took away
your what?"

Most importantly, I know I would have forgiven
my son much more quickly, and the whole thing
wouldn't have felt so traumatic. I might even have
gazed upon him with compassion.

Looking back, I realize I was completely
underutilizing my own brain. It is small comfort that
so many otherwise sane mortals share this failing.
Our attention flickers, our patience ebbs and—
propelled by fear, malice, craving and other deeply
inscribed passions—we lurch from impulse to action.

In contrast, practiced Buddhist meditators deploy
their brains with exceptional skill. Drawing on 2,500
years of mental technology—techniques for paying
careful attention to the workings of their own
minds—they develop expertise in controlling the
flow of their mental life, avoiding the emotional
squalls that often compel us to take personal feelings
oh, so personally, and clearing new channels for
awareness, calm, compassion and joy. Their example
holds the possibility that we can all choose to
modulate our moods, regulate our emotions and
increase cognitive capacity—that we can all become
high-performance users of our own brains.

"What we're talking about is a long-term strategy
for cultivating the heart and mind to fully draw forth
the beneficial capacities of the human mind," says B.
Alan Wallace, founder and president of the Santa
Barbara Institute for Consciousness Studies. A
Buddhist scholar who examines the interface
between science and religion, he believes that much
of human suffering is our own doing. Our feelings
contract around threats to our sense of self and cloud
our sense perceptions. We end up reacting, as if we
had no other choice.

Meditation alters what we tend to think of as
stable mental traits—anxiety, for example, or anger.
Practitioners discover that feelings are events that
rise in the psyche like bubbles off the bottom of a pot
of boiling water. "They learn to de-identify with their
emotions, making it easier to let them go," says
neuroscientist Richard Davidson of the University of
Wisconsin at Madison.

As the result of an extraordinary convergence of
scientific research into interior states and new
understanding of an ancient spiritual tradition, says
Jon Kabat-Zinn, founder of the pioneering Stress
Reduction Clinic at the University of Massachusetts
Medical Center, "Buddhist meditation is leading to
an expansion of the science of what it means to be
human."

### Ten Million Americans Can’t All Be Wrong

Some 10 million Americans say they practice
some form of meditation. Buddhism is unique among
spiritual traditions in its emphasis on psychology. Its
core teachings encourage practitioners to shake off
suffering and discover happiness. The very concept
of self-improvement informs _bhavana_, the Sanskrit
word commonly translated as "meditation," though it
literally means "cultivation." "It has exactly the same
connotation as when we say we 'cultivate a garden,' "
says Wallace.

The Buddha framed things differently. He taught
that our default mode may be to suffer, but only
because of ignorance. We can transcend our lot by
learning to quiet the mind in meditation—not merely
to relax and cope with stress, as the popular notion of
Buddhism holds, but to rigorously train oneself to
relinquish bad mental habits. Rather than being an
end in itself, meditation becomes a tool to investigate
your mind and change your worldview. You're not
tuning out so much as tuning up your brain,
improving your self-monitoring skills.

"You stop being always projected outside. You
start looking in and seeing how your mind works, and
you change your mind, thought by thought," explains
Matthieu Ricard, a Buddhist monk, scientist and
French interpreter for the Dalai Lama. "The French
intellectuals don't like this. They say, 'Let's be
spontaneous; passions are the beauty of life.' They
think that making an effort is not nice—a silly old
discipline—and that's why we're such a mess. But
many modern people understand the notion of getting
fit with physical training." So the idea of developing
mental skills with meditation is gaining ground.

### The Nod From Neuroscience

Encouragement for this new way of thinking
comes from an unusual ally. Neuroscience is
furnishing hard evidence that the brain is plastic,
endowed with a lifelong capacity to reorganize itself
with each new experience. "We now know that neural
firing can lead to changes in neural connections, and
experience leads to changes in neural firing,"
explains UCLA psychiatrist Daniel Siegel. Violinists'
brains actually change as they refine their skill. So do
the brains of London cabbies, whose livelihood
depends on the sharpness of their memory. Likewise,
through repeated practice in focusing attention,
meditators may be strengthening the neural circuitry
involved in the voluntary control of attention.

One Tibetan lama told Wallace that before
training, his mind was like a stag with great antlers
trying to make its way through a thick forest; the
animal got snagged on branches time after time. But
after many years of practice, his mind was more like
a monkey in a jungle, swinging freely from vine to
vine.

Such adepts are the Lance Armstrongs of
meditation, says Davidson, whose pioneering brain
scans of monks provide tantalizing evidence that
emotions like love and compassion are in fact
skills—and can be trained to a dramatic degree.
Studies also suggest that the monastic life is not a
requirement; even brief, regular meditation sessions
can yield substantial benefits. Nor is a belief in
Buddhism necessary. "I'm convinced that you can
make a huge difference in your life if you start out
with even 30 minutes a day," Ricard says. "By
maintaining the practice, there is a trickle of insights.
Drop by drop, you fill a jar."

One recent study at Massachusetts General
Hospital found that 40 minutes of daily meditation
appears to thicken parts of the cerebral cortex
involved in attention and sensory processing. In a
pilot study at the University of California at San
Francisco, researchers found that schoolteachers
briefly trained in Buddhist techniques who meditated
less than 30 minutes a day improved their moods as
much as if they had taken antidepressants.

There are many types of meditation, and they can
be used to develop a number of mental skills. This
attitude focuses on practices that address common
emotional struggles. Through basic meditation
techniques, it's possible to cultivate a longer attention
span, develop emotional stability, understand the
feelings of others and release yourself from the
constraints you place on your own happiness.

### Attention: Stabilize the Mind

Computers, pagers, video games, telemarketing
calls, nonstop e-mail—all blast our attention span to
smithereens. Modern life does a swell job of
distracting us. But perhaps the problem lies not in our
cell phones but in ourselves. After all, we're the ones
constantly making choices about what to attend to
and what to ignore.

The trouble is, most of us make these choices
semiconsciously at best. We don't even attempt to
control our attention, perhaps because we don't know
how. Buddhists maintain that the capacity can be
refined through a consistent practice of meditation:
The mind is by nature unstable, inherently
distractible, and meditation is a means of stabilizing
it.

"Meditation is _about_ paying attention," says
Kabat-Zinn. Cultivating concentration doesn't just
stabilize and clarify the mind, it can also improve
creativity and productivity while enhancing
relationships. Imagine if you actually paid attention
100 percent to your spouse!

The strategy that starts you on this road
is _mindfulness_, which means both cultivating
nonjudgmental awareness of a specific object and
seeing deeply into things. A common approach is to
focus on an object or on the sensations of your own
breathing, noting every inhale and exhale, and
patiently returning your attention to your breathing
each time it wanders.

"You practice focusing on one object," says
Clifford Saron, a neuroscientist at the Center for
Mind and Brain at the University of California at
Davis. "You begin to observe the flux of moment-to
moment perception. With practice you can detect
patterns in those fluctuations."

It's like you're flexing a muscle in the brain.
University of Wisconsin's Davidson contends that the
mental exercise of meditation strengthens and
stabilizes neural networks in the medial prefrontal
cortex—the brain's executive control center,
involved in the regulation of attention. "People don't
recognize that there is lots of plasticity in the
circuitry," he adds. "More than previously thought."

The effort in the exercise is to balance awareness
between dullness and distraction. To do so, you use
the self-monitoring process that psychologists
call _metacognition_: awareness of awareness. It's what
lets you know when, on the one side, you're starting
to drift off and need to muster fresh interest and, on
the other, you're getting distracted and need to bring
your attention back. As you gradually fine-tune your
concentration, you notice the habitual chaos of your
thoughts and, gradually, the calm that lies behind
them. "Awareness trumps thoughts," says Kabat-Zinn,
"because you can be aware of your thoughts."

In his book, _The Attention Revolution: Unlocking
the Power of the Focused Mind_, Wallace describes a
nine-stage program to achieve quiescence, a state the
Buddhists call shamatha (pronounced sha-ma-ta). As
one Buddhist scholar put it, attention becomes "an oil
lamp unmoved by the air; wherever the awareness is
directed, it is steady and sharply pointed."
Even among novices, studies show, a brief
meditation session can be more effective than a nap
in improving performance on tests that require
concentration. But its benefits don't stop there.
Meditation can radically transform emotion.

### Equanimity: Recognizing the Spark Before the Flame

Much of our emotional experience consists of
gusts of negative feelings blowing through the brain.
The feelings torture us without being intrinsically
related to experience. "Emotions are not actually
facts," explains Davidson.

The perturbations often function as our own
worst enemies, clotting our minds, keeping us from
seeing and responding clearly. In other words, they
diminish our capacity to live our lives. Negative
emotions are so distressing, studies show, that given
a choice many people would rather endure great
physical pain—say, high-voltage electric shocks.

Nevertheless, folks freely gorge on oversize
portions of mental anguish, what Stanford
neuroscientist Robert Sapolsky calls "adventitious
suffering—the pain of what was, what will be, what
could be or what someone else is experiencing."
Sapolsky has shown that over time such extra
helpings of mental suffering can damage the parts of
the brain involved in learning and memory, as well as
the immune system.

Decades before Sapolsky's studies, pioneering
cognitive psychologist Albert Ellis put forth the thenradical idea that painful emotions spring more from
people's beliefs than from reality itself: Thoughts
alone could lead to anguish. Today cognitive
behavioral therapists, including an aging Ellis,
counsel patients to relieve emotional distress by
changing the content of their thoughts—challenging
their beliefs and testing new possibilities.

Buddhist meditation addresses the same issue a
bit differently. It changes your relationship to your
emotions more than the emotions themselves. It
allows you to see mood fluctuations moment to
moment so that you can navigate around them. "You
become more like the sky than the storm," says
Kabat-Zinn. You can avoid the mental "grasping" of
judgmentalism or an impulsive need to act.

The approach appears to be effective. In a study
led by psychologist Zindel Segal at the University of
Toronto, meditation successfully prevented relapse
of depression in patients with a history of recurrent
mood disorder.

Meditation becomes a kind of "dashboard for
your emotions," Wallace says. It enables you to check
the gauges and objectively decide if you're about to
overheat, so you're not caught by surprise when
steam begins to rise from the engine. The "engine,"
in this case, is what is often called the limbic
system—or the emotional brain—which is connected
to the prefrontal cortex. Through its actions on the
prefrontal cortex, meditation can dampen affective
arousal from a limbic system kicked into alarm mode
by fear or anger.

Perhaps I could have recognized that my urge to
yell at my son as he dialed 911 was useless. Yet this
kind of clarity is difficult to achieve. For most of us,
the lag time between provocation, impulse and action
is shorter than a heartbeat—just a quarter of a second
between the trigger event and the response of the
amygdala, or fear center. In that fraction of a second,
our emotions have time to swamp our judgment—
and often do.

Meditation, however, promises to break this
apparent chain reaction by allowing us to recognize
"the spark before the flame." Through many hours of
quietly observing the customary tyranny of the
emotions, you may gradually familiarize yourself
with the quiet of your mind—the part that one day
might choose not to be tyrannized. Says Ricard, "You
become familiar with the way emotions arise, how
they can either overwhelm your mind or vanish
without making an impact."

### Compassion: Like Riding a Horse

Meditation is a process of cultivating intimacy
with one's own states of mind. "Mindfulness is a form
of intrapersonal attunement," says UCLA's Seigel,
which makes it the perfect tool for _inter_personal
attunement—in other words, compassion. "The
ability to see your own mind," Seigel notes, "allows
you to see others' minds."

As every parent of a teenager knows, compassion
can often be hard work. It takes effort to summon
warm feelings for someone who snarls at you while
asking for money. Some parents find they have to
play tricks on their own minds, such as forcing
themselves to remember the teen as a cuddly baby.

In meditating, Buddhists do something similar.
"You simply have to do it again and again," Ricard
insists. "It's not so sophisticated." Imagine someone
you already love, wish for her well-being and
gradually extend that feeling to others. This should
include people you may think of as enemies.

The next step is to extend that feeling of
compassion to all beings, letting the feeling "grow
and grow and invade your mind so that every single
atom of your self is loving kindness and compassion
and benevolence," Ricard says. "You let that linger
and linger and become more and more part of your
mindstream, and you do it again and again.
Eventually it becomes easier, faster and stronger the
rest of the time too, not just when you're meditating.
It's like riding a horse. In the beginning you have to
be very careful not to fall off, but pretty soon you
even forget you're on a horse."

Neurobiologically we seem wired for empathy.
Over the past few years, scientists have found that the
human brain has a system of mirror neurons,
activated both when we perform an action and when
we observe similar action by others, including the
facial expression of pain or joy. Such activation
allows us not only to infer others' feelings but to
actually share those feelings as well.

Scientists have only recently begun to map the
brain regions related to positive emotions such as
empathy. But when Davidson observed Ricard
meditating on compassion while hooked up to EEG
sensors, he found a striking increase in gamma waves
in the left prefrontal cortex, an area correlated with
reported feelings of happiness. The findings furnish
scientific support for something the Dalai Lama often
says: A person meditating on compassion for others
becomes the first beneficiary.

Compassion for others begins at home. "One who
loves himself will never harm another," the Buddha
is quoted as saying. A faithful meditation practice
demonstrates compassion for oneself, since it
involves conscious dedication of time and effort to
improving personal well-being. The insights gained
through such practice may make it easier to feel
kindness toward others; by growing aware of how
often you're swayed by emotions you may be slower
to blame others for similar lapses, less inclined to
interpret their actions as intentional slights.

Compassion can also help people manage their
own suffering, since it's a reminder that others are
also in pain. "After that, our pain does not feel as
oppressive," says Ricard. "We stop asking the bitter
question, Why me?" The link between compassion
for others and for oneself may explain why recent
studies connect altruism to health and happiness.

### Happiness: Your Birthright

From best-sellers on finding joy to a Harvard
course on "a fulfilling and flourishing life," happiness
is a popular American pursuit. Of course, there's
happiness and then there's happiness. Most of us hold
in high esteem the hedonic variety of happiness:
experiences of pleasure and, often, amassing material
goods and wealth. But there's another kind, called
eudaimonia, that rests on the realization of personal
goals and potential. The ideal runs in a ragged line
from Aristotle to Maslow to Sartre, paralleling
Buddhism somewhere along the way.

Buddhism asserts that lasting happiness is your
birthright. But it doesn't come from having; it comes
from freeing ourselves of mental blindness and
afflictive emotions. Once we have it, says Ricard, we
can see the world without veils or distortions. "It is
the joy of moving toward inner freedom and of the
loving kindness that radiates towards others."

The tricky part: One of those veils is the very idea
of an unchanging core self, or a soul. "We generate
our own suffering by complex processes of self-identification,"
says Kabat-Zinn. "The ego contracts
around things. Someone in traffic bumps my car. I
tell him he has ruined '_my_ day.'"

We are fundamentally interdependent with other
people and our environment, says Ricard in his new
book, Happiness. Each moment between birth and
death, the body undergoes innumerable
transformations, with the mind the theater of
countless emotional and conceptual experiences.
"Experience" is simply the content of mental flow.
Yet we assign permanence, uniqueness and
autonomy to the self. Such self-importance and ego-grasping
form the root of suffering.

Meditators find that when they stop taking their
own emotional upheavals so seriously, the self drops
away. They process the world more directly.
Absorption, a state similar to what is known as
"flow," increases. "People are hungry for this kind of
authentic experience," observes Kabat-Zinn.

Urging seekers of happiness to not only shake off
egoism but to understand the amorphous nature of the
ego itself remains a subversive idea in the West, even
though some leading neuroscientists have come to
the same conclusion. Wolf Singer, director of the
Max Planck Institute in Frankfurt, Germany, for
instance, describes the brain as lacking any decision-making
"coherence center." It's like an orchestra
without a conductor.

It's a tremendously hopeful possibility that brains
can change for the better—specifically, become
sharper, nicer, happier. Ricard may be his own best
argument. Many who encounter him are struck by the
sense of well-being he projects.

More than a year after my personal nadir of
parenthood—with that 911 call—I started meditating
on my own. Today I occasionally meditate with my
son, my not-quite-former fellow hothead. As we
focus on developing compassion for each other and
learning to be calm, he fiddles with the incense sticks.

As Kabat-Zinn says: "Awareness gives you your
life back. You can then decide what to do with it."
