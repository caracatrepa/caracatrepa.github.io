Guided Mindfulness Practices
============================

The free eight-week [Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction class][38] (MBSR)
includes a series of guided mindfulness practices, all of which are available
to anyone, free of charge, to be listened to here or downloaded to another
device (e.g., iPod or MP3 player). These are all accessible through the menu to
the left.

The **Body Scan**, **Sitting Meditation**, and **Mindful Yoga **recordings
comprise the primary practices of MBSR and are each about 30 minutes in length.

The **Soften, Soothe, Allow Meditation** (15 min) is introduced in Week 5 of
the course, the **Mountain Meditation** and **Lake Meditations** (20 min) are
introduced in Week 6, and the **Lovingkindness Meditation** (13 min) is
introduced in Week 7.

The **Silent Meditations** are provided for non-guided practice and are either
15, 20 or 30 minutes.
