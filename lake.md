> _In your meditation practice and in your daily life, can you be in touch, not only with the changing content and intensity of your thoughts and feelings...  
  
...but also with the vast unwavering reservoir of awareness itself, residing below the surface of your mind.  
  
The lake can teach this, remind us of the lake within our selves._
  
\- _Jon Kabat-Zinn_
