> _In your meditation practice and in your daily life, can you be in touch, not only with the changing content and intensity of your thoughts and feelings..._
> 
>_...but also with the vast unwavering reservoir of awareness itself, residing below the surface of your mind._
> 
> _The lake can teach this, remind us of the lake within our selves._
  
\- _Jon Kabat-Zinn_
