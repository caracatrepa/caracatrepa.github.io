Lovingkindness Meditation (13 min)
==================================

The Lovingkindness Meditation, sometimes known as a "Metta Prayer", is
traditionally done for successively wider circles of caring, beginning with
yourself (see a simple form of the [Metta Prayer][38]). Because many of us are
so self-critical that it can be difficult to find loving feelings for
ourselves, this meditation begins with a person who you know to be loving
towards you, and only after this do you bring focus to yourself, then
successively widening the circle of good will to those closest to you, then
those who you feel neutral toward, then those with whom you have difficulties,
and continuing outward until it includes all living beings.
