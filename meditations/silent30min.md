Silent Meditation (30 min)
==========================

This audio was created so that you could have a 30-minute silent meditation
without having to watch the clock. It begins with three chimes and ends with
three chimes, with silence between. There is also a [15-minute version][38] and
a [20-minute version][39].

_If you have an iPhone or Android-based smartphone, a good app is [ Insight
Timer][42]. With it you can set up a meditation period for any length of time
and you have a choice of bell sounds. It will even show you the locations of
other people around the world who are meditating the same time as you are!_

If I do not practice one day, I notice it.  
  
If I do not practice a second day, the orchestra notices it.  
  
If I do not practice a third day, the world notices it.
