Mindful Yoga 2 (36 min)
=======================

**NOTE:** This sequence is guided by Dr. Lynn Rossy, Health Psychologist for
the University of Missouri Wellness Program.

Even if you are very experienced in yoga, please be sure to read [Mindful
Yoga][38] before your first time doing this practice. _Mindful Yoga is
different than many traditional yoga practices in that there is less of a focus
on the exact posture achieved and more focus on body/mind awareness._

**_Special Note for those with physical limitations: _** _If these movements are
too challenging, and trying to do them, even with modifications, is painful or
harmful, a very gentle but powerful option is to follow [Thich Nhat Hahn's Ten
Mindful Movements][41]. This is a 15-minute sequence, so to get 30 minutes of
practice, you can go through it twice, or augment it with the parts of the yoga
you can do. Another option is to try [**Mindful Yoga 2 with camera emphasis on
chair poses**][42]. It is identical to the video for Mindful Yoga 1, except
that the camera is focused on another instructor who does all the poses from a
chair._

**_Whether or not you have physical limitations, be sure to modify the
movements in any way that makes them doable for you. Sensing what is
appropriate for you, and modifying the practices accordingly, is mindfulness in
itself._**

Below is an audio alternative to the video above. We recommend you view the
video at least the first few times to see how the poses are done, but
afterwards you may choose to use this audio version:

Once you are comfortable with it, you may choose to do the yoga without
guidance at all. Also, you are welcome to download the audio version to another
device. It can be accessed directly at <http://palousemindfulness.com/disks/yoga2.mp3>

> It's important to be aware of physical limits and to dwell at their boundary
long enough to experience them but it's just as important not to push beyond
them...  
  
Instead we are going to be looking deeply into each moment with full acceptance
and not trying to force ourselves to be different from how we are right now.
