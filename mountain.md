> _Through it all, the mountain just sits, experiencing change in each moment,
constantly changing, yet always just being itself..._
> 
> _It remains still as the seasons flow into one another and as the weather
changes moment by moment and day by day, calmness abiding all changeâ€¦_
  
\- _Jon Kabat-Zinn_
