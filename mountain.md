[ ![][43]

Through it all, the mountain just sits, experiencing change in each moment, constantly changing, yet always just being itself...  
  
It remains still as the seasons flow into one another and as the weather changes moment by moment and day by day, calmness abiding all changeâ€¦  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\- _Jon Kabat-Zinn_
