Practice Log - Week 1
=====================

**FORMAL PRACTICE:** Read [The Body Scan Meditation][1]. Do the [Body Scan][2] at least six times this
week. Don’t expect to feel anything in particular from this practice. In fact, give up all
expectations about it. Just let your experience be your experience. 

Record on this form each time you do the Body Scan. In the comment field, put just a few words to
remind you of your impressions of that particular body scan: what came up, how it felt, what you
noticed in terms of physical sensations, emotions, thoughts, etc. _**It’s important to write the
comments immediately after the practice because it will be hard to reconstruct later.**_

**INFORMAL PRACTICE:** Each day this week, see if you can bring mindful awareness to some
otherwise routine activity. Before you go to bed each night, see if you can recall at least one
example of “simple awareness” and record it on the [Informal Practice Log (Simple Awareness)][3].
