Informal Practice Log (Simple Awareness) – Week 1
=================================================

Each day this week, see if you can bring mindful awareness to some otherwise
routine activity. For instance, washing the dishes, waiting in line, sitting in
a boring meeting, walking from the car to your office. Remembering the raisin
exercise, you could also use this as an opportunity to bring mindful awareness
to eating, noting textures, smell, taste, touch, etc. Before you go to bed each
night, see if you can recall at least one example of “simple awareness”.

### Example

**What was the situation?  Where were you, who were you with, what were you
doing?**

_Washing dishes after dinner._

**What feelings, thoughts,
sensations did you notice
before you decided to
experience this mindfully?**

_I was feeling hurried, shoulders
and stomach tense, thinking “I
wish Chris hadn’t used so many
dishes!”_

**What feelings, thoughts
and sensations did you
notice WHILE doing this
mindfully?**

_I actually felt the warm water
on my hands, enjoyed seeing the
dishes sparkle, time seemed to
stop for a moment._

**What did you learn from
doing this?**

_Paying attention to physical
sensations brings me into the
here and now and a boring task
becomes more interesting._

**What feelings, thoughts
and sensations are you
noticing NOW as you write
this?**

_Feeling the support of the chair
I’m sitting on, the feel of the
pen, and feeling thankful that a
long day is over._
