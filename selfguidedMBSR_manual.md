The MBSR Manual
===============

Although _**it is not necessary to have a printed manual to benefit from the
program**_, we are offering a way for you to create your own manual if you
desire. Having printed materials makes it easier to see whatâ€™s been covered,
provides a very good reference for later review, and allows you to highlight
passages or make notes.

In our live class, the materials for each week (instructions, practice sheets,
readings) are not given out until we get to that week, so the manual builds as
the course progresses. You can build your own manual in the same way, adding to
the manual a little bit each week. Below are suggestions for assembling your
manual:

### Binder
We suggest using a 3-ring binder and one-inch rings, with clear pockets for the
cover and spine (such as an "Avery Durable View Binder with 1-inch slant
ring"). Here is the [graphic for the cover][1] and [title for the spine][2]
that we use for our local MBSR class. We usually use white binders for the
class since that blends best with the manual cover and spine graphic.

### Dividers for each of the 8 weeks
Use an 8-tab divider set to give each week a separate section. You can simply
write or print "Week 1", etc.  on each tab.

### First pages of the manual
Print the following pages for the very first section, before the divider for
"Week 1":

  * [Table of Contents][3]
  * [Introduction][4] (printer-ready version of the "Introduction" page)
  * [Getting Started][5] (printer-ready version of the "Getting Started" page)
  * [MBSR: An Introduction][6] (this is the article by Roberta Lewis that is mentioned on the Intro page)
  * [MBSR Research Summary][7] (also mentioned on the Intro webpage)
  
### Contents for Weeks 1-8
The contents for each of the eight weeks can be added later, as you progress
through the course. This is the way we do it in the live MBSR class - students
get that week's materials at the beginning of each weekly class.

At the bottom of each week's page, you will see instructions for the printing
for that week, including, at the very bottom, a link to a **"printer-ready"
version of that page**, formatted for inclusion in the manual (for instance,
see [Week 1][8] and scroll down to the bottom of the page).  Typically each
week's printing will include:

  * Overview and instructions for that week (e.g., what you see when you click on Week 1, Week 2, etc.)
  * Formal Practice Sheet for that week
  * Informal Practice Sheet for that week
  * Printed copies of material from the "Reading" section for that week

Some of the articles in the "Reading" sections are long, so if you are able to
print them double-sided, that will reduce the bulk of your manual.
