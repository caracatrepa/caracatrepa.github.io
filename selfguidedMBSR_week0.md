Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)
-----------------------------------------

> _"Mindfulness is about being fully awake in our lives. It is about perceiving
the exquisite vividness of each moment..."_

\- _Jon Kabat-Zinn_

For most of us, when this happens, it's unexpected, maybe while walking on a
mountain trail on a crisp autumn day, or being so focused in work or play that
you are not thinking about past or future, or connecting with someone in a way
that makes it seem like time is standing still. This state of being alive and
whole in the present moment is always available, but it typically eludes us,
especially in times of difficulty and external pressures.

"Mindfulness" is used in many contexts nowadays and there are many different
understandings of the term. Diana Winston of UCLA's Mindful Awareness Research
Center gives my favorite definition: **_Paying attention to present moment
experience with open curiosity and a willingness to be with what is_**.

### [_Mindfulness: Being Fully Awake in Our Own Lives_][39]
This [10-minute video][39] from the Center for Mindfulness at the University of
Massachusetts Medical School is a good introduction to what we mean by
mindfulness in the context of this course. It is narrated by Saki Santorelli,
the current director at UMass. 

### [ _Introduction to the MBSR Course_ ][41]
This [7-minute video][41], narrated by Jon Kabat-Zinn and others involved in
the founding of MBSR, provides some interesting background about the MBSR
course. MBSR is a blend of meditation, body awareness, and yoga: learning
through practice and study how your body handles (and can resolve) stress
neurologically. Also see the two-page article, [MBSR: An Introduction][42], a
short but engaging piece about MBSR.   

### [ _MBSR Research_][43]  
This [3-min video][43] from the [UMass Medical School][45], gives a very brief
overview of _**30 years of research**_ about the effects of MBSR. The 2-page
document, [MBSR Research Summary][46], is a concise, if dated, compilation of
MBSR research. See the [Scientific Research page][47] for more recent
research.

### What will taking an MBSR course do for me?  
Through this MBSR course, you will learn skills that can increase your ability to:  

* Cope with stress, pain, and the challenges of everyday life
* Deal with disturbing events with grace and composure
* Be fully present and alive in this moment

While MBSR is not a "cure" for serious medical conditions and should not be
used as a substitute for medical treatment, research indicates that mindfulness
training can have a significant therapeutic effect for those experiencing
stress, anxiety, high blood pressure, depression, chronic pain, migraines,
heart conditions, diabetes and other ailments. In addition, participants
typically report feeling more alive, more "in-tune" with themselves and others.

### If you want to know even more...  
You don't really need to know more about mindfulness to get started with the
MBSR course, but if you are interested, there is an information-packed
[74-minute video by Jon Kabat-Zinn][48] that goes into much more detail than
the short videos above, including more about the research that validates the
practice of mindfulness in terms of physical health and psychological
well-being.

### The importance of practice  
This course is highly experiential and the daily practice is perhaps the most
important component. You wouldn't expect to learn to surf by reading a book
about surfboards and waves, and learning a mindfulness practice is no different
than any other skill that involves both mind and body. You know from your own
experience in learning to play an instrument, or a sport, or any complex skill
whatsoever, that practice is important. _**Your body/mind is the most complex
instrument in the universe. It takes time and practice to use it effectively
and harmoniously.**_

For this reason, we recommend that you set aside about **30 minutes a day** for
practice. _**This may be the most difficult hurdle you face in getting started
because one of the very issues you are facing may be not having enough time for
all that needs to get done in a day - how are you going to find an extra 30
minutes?**_ Previous participants have said that after a few weeks of practice,
although their time to "do things" is technically 30 minutes less, there can be
a feeling of having more space and time, even in the middle of a very busy day.

going on to Week 1.*_
