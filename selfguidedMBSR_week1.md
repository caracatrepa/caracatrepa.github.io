Week 1 - Simple Awareness
=========================

Introduction to the Body Scan
-----------------------------

Now that you've experienced the [Introduction][14] and completed the [Getting
Started Worksheet][38] (see [Getting Started][15]), you are ready to begin.
_**Welcome!**_

_NOTE:_ _The links to all the materials described below are given in the
colored section at the bottom of the page._

### Videos  
The videos for this week begin with the **"60 Minutes"  Special on
Mindfulness**, reported by Anderson Cooper of CBS and CNN, followed by two
short videos by Jon Kabat-Zinn, **Life is Right Now**, in which he talks about
how science is beginning to understand the process and effects of meditation,
and **Befriending the Body**, where he talks about the importance of our
relationship with our body in this course. The video, **Managing Anxiety with
Mindfulness** by Rachel Green, was originally made to address anxiety,
specifically test anxiety and panic attacks, but provides a great introduction
to some of the basic components of mindfulness meditation, including mindful
eating and breath meditation. Finally, Bob Stahl guides you through a **Raisin
Meditation** using a single raisin. _**To get the most benefit out of Bob's
video, bring a raisin when you sit down to watch it so you can experience on
your own what he is describing in the video.**_

### Readings
Each week, there are readings which are an important part of the program. This
week, the main reading is about the **Body Scan Meditation** you will be doing
for your 30 minutes of daily practice this week. **7 Myths of Meditation**, and
**Why We Find It So Hard to Meditate** address common misunderstandings,
including the idea that one must have a quiet mind to meditate
successfully. **What Would It Take for You to Be Still** describes one
person's personal experience with mindfulness and will give you a little
bit more of an idea of what to expect from this course.

### Daily Practices  
This week begins your 30-minute daily **Formal Practice**, which is the **Body
Scan Meditation**, which you can find in the menu just to the left of this text
under "Guided Practices". Below, you can see the link to the **Formal Practice
sheet**, where you will be making brief notes about your practice. _[NOTE: If
you will be completing this by hand, print the **PDF file**, but if you'd like
to complete it on your computer, download the **WORD file**.]_

For the **Informal Practice** this week, it is suggested that you bring mindful
awareness to some otherwise routine activity such as washing the dishes and/or
eating a meal. At the end of each day, using the **Informal Practice sheet**
you will be printing or downloading for this week (see below), take just five
minutes or so to see if you can recall a daily activity which you brought
awareness to that day.

### Supplementary reading  
In addition, each week will indicate some supplementary reading or viewing
materials. Listed there are suggestions for background reading or viewing if
you'd like to know more about a given week's topic. Of special interest this
week are two great resources having to do with eating mindfully: **Mouthfuls of
Mindfulness,** written by Jan Chozen Bays and a video, **Introduction to
Mindful Eating,** by Michelle DuVal.
