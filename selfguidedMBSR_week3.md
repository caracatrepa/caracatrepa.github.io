Week 3 - Dealing with Thoughts
==============================

Introduction to Yoga
--------------------

At this point in your practice, you may be noticing just how busy the mind is,
with replays of past events, expectations/fears about the future, or
evaluations of present experience (I like this, don't lke that, when will this
be over, etc.). It can seem that the object of meditation is to get rid of all
thoughts and distractions, and when that isn't happening, you may feel like you
are failing at meditation and/or the meditation can turn into a struggle,
wanting your experience to be different than it is. In fact, the kind of
meditation you are learning is more about working skillfully with _**any**_
internal or external experience, and isn't really about "getting rid" of
thoughts and distractions. In fact, it can be said that wandering thoughts are
the weights that train the muscles of the mind.

### Videos  
It's common for there to be a sense of pushing oneself in meditation, and the
first video, **Non-Striving**, addresses the possibility of taking the striving
out of meditation (and life!). The second video, **Attention, Intention,
Attitude**, explores the attitude we take toward ourselves in meditation, which
is often harsh, and the possibility of being gentler with ourselves. In the
third video, **Dealing with Thoughts (in life and in meditation)**, Tara Brach
talks about our relationship with thoughts, including a short practice of
intentionally bringing awareness to thoughts. The last video, **Surrender to
the Monkeys**, is also by Tara, and addresses our wanting for things to be
different than they are and the wisdom of taking things just as they are.

### Reading  
The reading list this week begins with **Mindful Yoga** by Jon Kabat-Zinn. It's
important to read this before beginning the Yoga practice that begins this
week. The other articles in this section address some common misconceptions in
meditation. In **Meditation: It's Not What You Think**, Jon Kabat-Zinn points
out that while meditation can often be accompanied by peace and relaxation,
"_meditation is not relaxation spelled differently_", and as Erik Wikstrom says
in the quote above, _"The moments of stillness are one of meditation's
byproducts, not the practice itself."_ The last two articles **Thoughts on
Thinking** and **I Hadn't Thought of That**, address directly the concern that
new (and sometimes even experienced) meditators have with thoughts that seem to
"get in the way" of the meditation.

### Daily Practices  
For the **formal practice** this week, we introduce **Mindful Yoga** (Yoga 1)
into your 30 minute practice, alternating with the Sitting Meditation and
choosing one day to do a Body Scan. This is all outlined in your Week 3
Practice Log, below. _**Even if you are an experienced yoga practitioner, be
sure to read "Mindful Yoga" in the reading below, before beginning the yoga
practice. Mindful Yoga is different than many traditional yoga practices in
that there is less of a focus on the exact posture achieved and more focus on
body/mind awareness.**_

The **informal practice** is about becoming aware of how we experience and
process unpleasant events. Just as in previous weeks, allow a few minutes
before going to sleep to complete the informal practices log. _Below are your

The moments of stillness are one of meditation's byproducts, not the practice itself._
