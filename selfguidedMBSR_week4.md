Week 4 - Stress: Responding vs. Reacting
========================================

STOP: The One-minute Breathing Space
------------------------------------

### This week's videos  
We begin with **Stress - Portrait of a Killer**, featuring Robert Sapolsky, a
neuroscientist at Stanford University and possibly the world's greatest
authority on the causes and effects of stress. This video describes the
physiology of stress and how, in modern life, our stress response, designed
evolutionarily to protect us from danger, can actually put our lives in danger
when it is activated continually and without resolution. This is the bad news.

The good news, **How To Make Stress Your Friend**, comes from Kelly McGonigal,
a psychologist specializing in health medicine, who puts stress in perspective,
re-framing stress, not as an enemy to health and well-being, but as a response
which is protective and even life-giving. She perhaps goes a little too far in
saying that health-endangering stress simply comes from a "belief that stress
is bad", but her video provides a good counter-balance to the idea that stress
is always bad. In the last video, Susan Bauer-Wu describes how mindfulness can
counteract a disproportionate stress reaction and introduces you to **STOP,** a
mindfulness practice you can use literally anywhere anytime to ground you and
help you to be more resilient and effective in the face of difficult
situations.

### Reading  
**What Is Stress** and Harvard Health's **Understanding the Stress Response**,
describe the physiological and neurological effects of stress, distinguishing
between acute stress, which is short-term and adaptive, and chronic stress,
which is the primary cause of stress-related health problems. **Anatomy of
Fear** is a graphic depiction of the stress response. **STOP: One-minute
Breathing Space** is a one-page description of the process you will be using
for this week's informal practice, and **The Magic Quarter Second** is a short
    article by Tara Brach that weaves in some science to validate "STOP".

### Daily Practices  
For the **formal practice**, we introduce "Yoga 2" and continue with the
Sitting Meditation, alternating between them. If there are any of the yogas you
haven't yet tried, this could be the time to try one or more of them.

For the **informal practice**, you will look for opportunities to practice
**STOP** during the course of the day. Don't expect to remember the precise
steps of "STOP" during the most trying parts of the day - it's enough just to
remember to stop and take a breath. The best way to make it second nature is to
practice it when you aren't stressed, such as during the "in between" times,
like waiting in line, walking from one office to another, getting in/out of
your car, etc.
