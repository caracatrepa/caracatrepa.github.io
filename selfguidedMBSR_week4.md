Week 4 - Stress: Responding vs. Reacting

STOP: The One-minute Breathing Space

This week's videos  
We begin with **Stress - Portrait of a Killer**, featuring Robert Sapolsky, a neuroscientist at Stanford University and possibly the world's greatest authority on the causes and effects of stress. This video describes the physiology of stress and how, in modern life, our stress response, designed evolutionarily to protect us from danger, can actually put our lives in danger when it is activated continually and without resolution. This is the bad news.

The good news, **How To Make Stress Your Friend**, comes from Kelly McGonigal, a psychologist specializing in health medicine, who puts stress in perspective, re-framing stress, not as an enemy to health and well-being, but as a response which is protective and even life-giving. She perhaps goes a little too far in saying that health-endangering stress simply comes from a "belief that stress is bad", but her video provides a good counter-balance to the idea that stress is always bad. In the last video, Susan Bauer-Wu describes how mindfulness can counteract a disproportionate stress reaction and introduces you to **STOP,** a mindfulness practice you can use literally anywhere anytime to ground you and help you to be more resilient and effective in the face of difficult situations.

Reading  
**What Is Stress** and Harvard Health's **Understanding the Stress Response**, describe the physiological and neurological effects of stress, distinguishing between acute stress, which is short-term and adaptive, and chronic stress, which is the primary cause of stress-related health problems. **Anatomy of Fear** is a graphic depiction of the stress response. **STOP: One-minute Breathing Space** is a one-page description of the process you will be using for this week's informal practice, and **The Magic Quarter Second** is a short article by Tara Brach that weaves in some science to validate "STOP".

Daily Practices  
For the **formal practice**, we introduce "Yoga 2" and continue with the Sitting Meditation, alternating between them. If there are any of the yogas you haven't yet tried, this could be the time to try one or more of them.

For the **informal practice**, you will look for opportunities to practice **STOP** during the course of the day. Don't expect to remember the precise steps of "STOP" during the most trying parts of the day - it's enough just to remember to stop and take a breath. The best way to make it second nature is to practice it when you aren't stressed, such as during the "in between" times, like waiting in line, walking from one office to another, getting in/out of your car, etc.

Between stimulus and response there is a space.  
  
In that space is our power to choose our response.  
  
In our response lies our growth and our freedom.
