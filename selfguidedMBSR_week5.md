Week 5 - Dealing with Difficult Emotions/Sensations
===================================================

Soften, Soothe, Allow
---------------------

### Mid-way assessment  
We are now at the halfway point, and this is a good time to reflect on what's
been happening so far for you in doing the practices and in your daily life. So
far, you have experienced the three main formal practices (body scan, sitting
meditation, yoga) and a number of informal practices (simple awareness, mindful
eating, awareness of pleasant/unpleasant experiences, STOP/one minute breathing
space).

Taking the time now for reflection will help you to notice and appreciate any
positive changes that may have resulted from the practices. A likely outcome of
this awareness and active appreciation will be a strengthening and
reinforcement that can naturally carry forward to the end of this course and
beyond. Also, now would be the time to reflect on those areas where you may
still be struggling, and allow the possibility of appropriate mid-course
corrections. **It can be helpful to actually write down your thoughts at this
point, reflecting on your personal learnings as well as the things you may
still be struggling with**. As you do this, you may recall a specific incident
in your life that stands out, that somehow relates to the work you have done so
far in this course.

### Dealing with physical and emotional discomfort  
This week’s topic has to do with dealing with discomfort, both physical and
emotional. We normally react to pain or discomfort in one of two ways:

#### Blocking
We try to block or deny the discomfort by pushing through it through force of
will, by distracting ourselves, or by self-medicating with food, alcohol or
drugs. This is ultimately unsatisfactory since as soon as you stop “pushing
through” or your distraction or self-medication wears off, it can come back
even stronger. In cases where the discomfort is a signal indicating corrective
action needs to take place, missing the signal can result in injury or disease.
And, of course, self-medicating can create many problems, including complex
side-effects or even addiction.

#### Drowning
We become overwhelmed by it, drowning in the discomfort and its associated
fears or judgments (“I can’t stand this!”, “What if this continues or gets
worse?”, “How could they/I have been so stupid?!?”, etc.). This leads to
incapacitation and a sense of hopelessness and powerlessness.

It's bad enough that neither of these strategies are very effective or
satisfying, but a continuing reliance on them usually makes things even worse
than they already are. There is a middle ground, a place where you are neither
pushing away difficult feelings/situations, nor being subsumed by them. This
"middle way" involves learning to feel the sensations or emotions, but not
being swept away by them. A surprising and counter-intuitive result of staying
with something in this way is that the "I've got to get out of here" component
of the discomfort often lessens, or sometimes can even disappear.

_**NOTE:** If a primary reason for you taking the MBSR course is dealing with
physical pain (e.g., chronic pain, fibromyalgia, serious injury or physical
disability, etc.), you can find alternative videos, readings and practice
assignments by going to [Week 5 (special instructions for Physical Pain)][22].
Otherwise, continue on here..._

### Videos  
In **Turning Toward Difficulty**, Vidyamala Burch of [Breathworks][38]
describes this counter-intuitive "middle way". Her mindfulness teaching is
primarily concerned with chronic physical pain, but this presentation applies
just as well to emotional pain. In **The Three Components of Self-Compassion**,
Kristin Neff talks about the importance of dealing with difficult emotional and
physical issues with self-kindness and gentleness. Finally, in **Awakening
Self-Compassion**, Tara Brach describes RAIN, a particular way of tapping into
this "middle way", again emphasizing the importance of self-compassion.

_**For further exploration:** The most sophisticated and transformative method
I know of for tapping into this "middle way", well worth exploring, but beyond
the scope of this course, is **Focusing**, a process created by Gene Gendlin
and refined by Ann Weiser Cornell. See **"Inner Listening" \- An Introduction
to Focusing** in the supplementary materials._

### Readings  
The readings for this week include **Thinking with the Heart**, by Chris
Germer, which describes the origination of the _Soften-Soothe-Allow_ process.
**The Soften, Soothe, Allow process** is a one-page description of the process
that will be used for the informal practice this week. **Buddhism's Pain
Relief** describes this "middle way" of dealing with pain, relating recent
advances in neuroscience with ancient Buddhist teachings. If you or a loved one
is dealing with back pain, **The Strange Case of Chronic Back Pain** is a
must-read. If so, see also Ron Siegel's book, **Back Sense**, in the
supplementary materials.

### Daily Practices
For the **formal practice**, we focus a little more on the sitting meditation,
alternating it with your choice of one of the other practices. On the first
day, though, if you have something that happened that is mildly difficult, try
the **Soften, Soothe, Allow Meditation** (see it on the menu to the left). The
situation doesn't have to be a major issue, in fact, it's best if it's mild or
moderate. For instance, it could be impatience while waiting in line or being
mildly annoyed by some minor event.

The **informal practice** will be to try the **Soften, Soothe, Allow process**
at times when you are experiencing an unwanted emotion. As mentioned above,
it's best not to start with the most pressing issue in your life. _If, at the
end of the day, no unwanted emotion comes to mind, take the time to feel
gratitude for something that happened that day._

> _You can have compassion for yourself - which is not self-pity.  
You're simply recognizing that 'this is tough, this hurts,'  
and bringing the same warmhearted wish for suffering to lessen or end  
that you would bring to any dear friend  
grappling with the same pain, upset, or challenges as you._

\- _Rick Hanson_

  

> _The most intimate relationship we will have in our entire lifetime is with ourselves.  
No one hears our hearts the way we do.  
No one knows our hurts the way we do.  
We are the sages of our soft spots and our edges.  
Self-compassion is showing up to that relationship with honesty and with love._

\- _Jamie Ridler_
