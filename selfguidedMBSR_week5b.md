Week 5b - Special Instructions for Physical Pain
================================================

The Five-Step "PAIN" Process
----------------------------

_**NOTE:** This page contains an alternative set of resources for Week 5 and is
designed **specifically for people who are experiencing significant physical
discomfort due to chronic pain, fibromyalgia, serious injury or physical
disability.** All the materials you'll need for this week are given below, but
you should also look over the [main Week 5 page][21]._

### "Physical" vs "Emotional" Pain  
The complex interaction between physical, emotional and mental realms makes it
inaccurate to say a discomfort is "just mental/emotional" or "just physical".
Significant physical pain is emotionally difficult and significant emotional
pain has physical consequences and correlates. Even so, there are some physical
conditions that are so difficult that a special approach may be helpful.

### Videos  
In addition to **Turning Toward Difficulty** and **The Three Components of
Self-Compassion**, which are also on the main Week 5 page, **Mindfulness-Based
Pain Management** goes into more detail about dealing with difficult or chronic
pain. This is an inspiring video in which Vidyamala Burch of [Breathworks][38]
talks about her journey with the chronic pain and disability that began with an
accident when she was a teenager, and in which she describes her novel approach
to chronic pain. Jon Kabat-Zinn calls Vidyamala's approach _**"the most
comprehensive, in-depth, scientifically up-to-date and user-friendly approach
to learning the how of living with chronic pain and reclaiming one's life that
I know of."**_ If you'd like to know even more about her story, there are
several interesting interviews of her in the supplementary materials.

You don't need to view _Awakening Self-Compassion_ by Tara Brach, but it is a
great video and if you have time and would like to see it, you'll find it
located on the [main Week 5 page][21].

### Readings  
The suggestions for informal practice described in Week 5 can be very helpful
with physical issues, but Vidyamala's _Five-Step PAIN process_ is likely to be
more effective. **The Five-Step Model**, describes this process in detail, and
**The Five-Step PAIN process** is a one-page summary which will be useful for
the informal practice. Two readings also given on the main Week 5 page are
**Buddhism's Pain Relief** and **The Strange Case of Chronic Back Pain** (a
must-read if you or someone you know has back issues, and if so, see also Ron
Siegel's **Back Sense** in the supplementary section).

### Practice  
The **formal practice** is the same as is given in Week 5. As indicated there,
we focus a little more on the sitting meditation, alternating it with your
choice of one of the other practices. On the first day, though, if you have
something that happened that is mildly difficult, try the **Soften, Soothe,
Allow Meditation** (see it on the menu to the left). The situation doesn't have
to be a major issue, in fact, it's best if it's mild or moderate. For instance,
it could be impatience while waiting in line or being mildly annoyed by some
minor event.

For the daily **informal practice**, instead of Soften-Soothe-Allow, try the
**Five-Step PAIN process** at times when you are experiencing physical
discomfort or pain. The discomfort doesn't have to be major, it could just be a
minor ache or physical irritation._If you are lucky enough to have a day with
no aches or pains to speak of, take the time to feel gratitude for this or
something else that happened that day._ If you like, you can also try the
_Soften, Soothe, Allow_ process on one or two days instead of the Five-Step
PAIN process (if you'd like to do this, more info about _Soften, Soothe,
Allow_, as well as practice sheets , are given on main Week 5 page).

> _It's simply being kind to myselfâ€”meeting myself, whatever my emotional,
physical or psychological state, with loving kindness. As simple, and
difficult, as that!_

\- _Marianne Elliot_


> _Life is difficult. This is a great truth, one of the greatest truths. It is a
great truth because once we truly see this truth, we transcend it. Once we
truly know that life is difficult, once we truly understand and accept it,
then life is no longer difficult. Because once it is accepted, the fact that
life is difficult no longer matters._

\- _M. Scott Peck_
