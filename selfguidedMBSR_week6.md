Week 6 - Mindfulness and Communication
======================================

Mountain & Lake Meditations
---------------------------

If you were to consider all the truly stressful situations in your life, you'd
probably find that many, if not most, involve other people. This week, we focus
on communication and what it means to be mindful in our interactions with
others, whether it be family members, co-workers or neighbors. Our focus up
until now has been on our internal world (thoughts, feelings and sensations);
now we move from the intra-personal to the inter-personal, taking into account
another's world, and the place where their world and ours meet. This means
recognizing that "the other" (person or persons) have their own perceptions,
feelings and needs, which are almost certainly different than ours.

### Listening  
Most of us don't really listen very deeply when we are in conversation. As Tara
Brach says in **The Sacred Art of Listening**: _"We spend most of our moments
when someone is speaking, planning what we're going to say, evaluating it,
trying to come up with our presentation of our self, or controlling the
situation. Pure listening is a letting go of control. It's not easy and takes
training… The bottom line is when we are listened to, we feel connected. When
we're not listened to, we feel separate."_

### Dealing with Conflict  
Effective communication with those who we disagree with is extraordinarily
difficult. If you are like most people, you have a fall-back strategy to deal
with conflict that was learned early in life, one that is habitual and embedded
in interactions with others. The three most common strategies are:
**accommodate** ("be nice"), **demand** ("me first"), or **withdraw** ("I don't
care"). There is a fourth way, one that involves investigating both your world
and the other's world, that can sometimes yield a surprising and creative
solution that honors both worlds. In the martial art, Aikido, this would be
called **blending**, a move that harms neither party and turns conflict into
more of a dance than a fight. This is complex and an art form in itself, and
forms the basis of Marshall Rosenberg's **Non-Violent Communication (NVC)**,
something that is briefly introduced this week.

### Videos  
Susan Piver, in an entertaining and provocative presentation, **The Art of
Being Heard**, describes four principles of mindful communication (timing,
listening, agenda-less-ness, confidence). Her description of confidence may
surprise you, especially given the fact that this particular presentation was
given to a business audience. In the second video, Tara Brach talks about **The
Sacred Art of Listening**, and in **Awakening Through Conflict**, she begins to
answer the question of how one deals with conflict in communication.

### Reading  
Included in the reading is a written companion to the video above by Tara
Brach, also called **The Sacred Art of Listening.** Anger is sometimes confused
with hatred and identified as an emotion that a "spritual" person would not
have. Sylvia Boorstein clarifies this misunderstanding with **The Most
Frequently Asked Question**. Our typical way of dealing with anger is to either
externalize it or stuff it, and in **The Answer to Anger** Pema Chodron
describes a powerful middle way, neither exploding nor imploding. **Conflict
Management Styles** describes the four ways of dealing with conflict outlined
above (accommodate, demand, withdraw, blend), and **The Heart of Non-Violent
Communication (NVC)** by Marshall Rosenberg, is an introduction to NVC, a
skillful way of communicating in difficult situations. For those wishing to
know more about NVC, see the Supplementary Materials.

### Daily Practices  
This week, we introduce the **Mountain Meditation** and the **Lake
Meditation**, one of which we suggest you try at least once this week, in place
of one of your normal 30 minute practices. These are both shorter practices (20
min), so on the day you do one of these meditations, you will have a shorter
practice session (if you’d like a full 30 minutes, you can add 10 minutes of
silent meditation on your own that day).

For the **formal practice** this week, we are now at a point where you can
freely choose between any of the three main practices you've experienced so
far: Body Scan, Sitting Meditation, Yoga (and the Mountain Meditation or Lake
Meditation at least one day).

The **informal practices** up until now have been focusing on the
intra-personal (what's happening inside you) and now we begin paying attention
to the inter-personal, using the **Communication Calendar**, noticing what
happens when we bring mindfulness into relationship.

> _To listen is to lean in softly  
with a willingness to be changed  
by what we hear._
  
\- _Mark Nepo_

> _When is the last time that you had a great conversation, a conversation that
wasn't just two intersecting monologues, which is what passes for conversation
a lot in this culture? But... a great conversation, in which you overheard
yourself saying things that you never knew you knew? That you heard yourself
receiving from somebody words that absolutely found places within you that you
thought you had lost... a conversation that brought the two of you on to a
different plane?... a conversation that continued to sing in your mind for
weeks afterwards...  
I've had some of them recently ... they are food and drink
for the soul._
  
\- _John O'Donohue_
