Week 7 - Mindfulness and Compassion
===================================

Lovingkindness Meditation
-------------------------

In some mindfulness courses, the linkage between mindfulness and compassion is
not very explicit. If one were to rely only on a secular definition of
mindfulness, which typically emphasizes paying close attention to one's own
experience and staying in the present moment, an argument could be made that a
trained killer could be perfectly mindful, _and be more a effective killer as a
result_, with no contradiction to this secular definition. Of course, something
seems very wrong with this, since kindness and compassion are at the core of
almost every meditative tradition. Moreover, _**self**_-kindness may be the
most important component of MBSR - itâ€™s the oil that makes the gears of
mindfulness work. Without it, the practices are dry at best, and harsh and
counter-productive at worst.

### Videos and Reading  
The first video, **The Evolutionary Roots of Compassion**, explores the idea
that we, as humans, have a deep-seated inclination to care for others, and the
article, **Survival of the Kindest**, indicates that even Darwin believed this.
As natural as the capacity for compassion is, Matthieu Ricard, a Buddhist monk
who has logged 50,000 hours of meditation practice and who also has a PhD in
cellular genetics, makes the case for consciously supporting this capacity in
the video, **Cultivating Altruism**.

We also explore the natural linkages there are with mindfulness and compassion
in Shauna Shapiro's video, **How Mindfulness Cultivates Compassion**, her
article, **Does Mindfulness Make You Compassionate**, and Jon Kabat-Zinn's
video, **Compassion and Mindfulness**.

In our culture, it can be argued that the person we are least kind to is
ourselves, and in **Self-Compassion**, Farida Zaman points out our tendency to
be overly critical of ourselves and describes some ways to cultivate a healthy
self-compassion. In the video, **Overcoming Objections to Self-Compassion**,
and in the article, **The Five Myths of Self-Compassion**, Kristin Neff
explores misconceptions about self-compassion, including the belief that
motivation requires self-criticism, and the idea that being kinder to ourselves
makes us complacent and less effective.

### Daily Practices  
In keeping with this theme, we introduce the **Lovingkindness Meditation**,
which we suggest you try at least once this week. It is a shorter practice (13
min), so when you do this meditation, you can extend it for another 17 minutes
to give yourself a full 30 minutes on that day. Or, if you'd like to extend a
bit of lovingkindess to yourself(!), you can stop at the end of the 13 minute
meditation.

For the **formal practice** this week, you can choose between any of the three
main practices you've experienced so far: Body Scan, Sitting Meditation, Yoga,
including at least one day of the Lovingkindness meditation.

For the **informal practice**, on any given day, you may choose any of the
practices you've experienced so far (e.g., simple awareness, mindful eating,
STOP, Soften-Soothe-Allow) and enter your experience on the supplied log.

> _If we could read the secret history of our enemies, we should find in each
man's life sorrow and suffering enough to disarm all hostility._
  
\- _Henry W. Longfellow_

  

> Hurt people hurt people. That's how pain patterns get passed on, generation
after generation after generation.   
>
Break the chain today. Meet anger with sympathy, contempt with compassion,
cruelty with kindness. Greet grimaces with smiles. Forgive and forget about
finding fault. Love is the weapon of the future  
  
\- _Yehuda Berg_

  
> To love our neighbors as we love ourselves means also to love ourselves as we
love our neighbors. It means to treat ourselves with as much kindness and
understanding as we would the person next door who is in trouble.  
  
\- _Frederick Buechner_
