Week 8 - Conclusion
===================

Developing a Practice of Your Own
---------------------------------

### Time to reflect...  
This brings us to the final week of the course, and if you have been watching
the videos, reading the recommended material, and doing the practices, you have
accomplished a lot! As a result of your dedicated learning and practice, it's
likely that there have been some changes in you since you began, so now might
be a good time to ask yourself: _**What changes have you noticed since you
began the course?**_ The changes may be different than you expected and they
might not be monumental. They could include subtle shifts, such as discovering
that you are sometimes able to find space in the middle of a busy day, or that
you are a little more resilient in encounters with others, or you're just a
little kinder to yourself in difficult situations. It's often the subtle
changes that are actually most profound, because they indicate learning that
has been integrated, that they come from the inside-out rather than top-down.

### Developing a practice of your own  
Although there are videos and readings for this week, there are no practice
sheets. Sometimes, we say that the eighth week of an MBSR class starts now but
does not really have an end. If this course has been useful for you so far, you
may want to consider the question: _**How will you continue practicing
mindfulness in your daily life, on your own?**_ You may decide that you would
like to continue the practice in a formal way, incorporating in your schedule a
sitting meditation or yoga, for instance, or you may already have an idea of
how you would incorporate into your life one or more of the many informal
practices (e.g., simple awareness, mindful eating, STOP, Soften-Soothe-Allow,
or PAIN processes).

Of the people who take the MBSR course and have found ways to incorporate
mindfulness into their lives, every one of them does it in a unique way, a way
that suits their temperament and needs. One person might continue with a
30-minute per day meditation practice, another might take a regular yoga class,
another may have made their daily walk into a meditation using present-moment
awareness of their inner and outer worlds as they walk, and yet another may
intentionally use one or more of the many informal practices throughout their
day. The important thing is not the specific practices you choose, but that you
make them yours, and that they resonate with you in a way that and that they
help you to be more alive, engaged and joyful in your daily life.

### Videos and Reading  
The videos include **Mindfulness is Not A Crystal Ball**, a brief summary of
mindfulness in daily life by Susan Kaiser Greenland, a video by Tara Brach on
**Happiness**, and a funny but poignant piece, **How My Son Ruined My Life**,
by James Baraz's mother. In **Compassion and Mindfulness**, Jon Kabat-Zinn
reinforces the key role that compassion and self-compassion play in this
course. The last video is a reading of **The Rabbi's Gift**, a beautiful story
illustrating the transformative power of seeing the goodness in others (and
ourselves). The video is narrated by M. Scott Peck himself. The readings
include some short documents having to do with developing a daily mindfulness
practice, an article by Rachel Naomi Remen about serving vs. helping, and a
printable version of The Rabbi's Gift.

### Certificate of completion  
If you have completed the practices each week and absorbed the videos and
readings, _**Congratulations!**_ This course is not a trivial accomplishment -
it takes significant commitment to do the required practice and study on your
own. If you would like a certificate documenting your completion of this online
course, see [Requesting a Certificate of Completion][26].

### Taking it from here...  
The many audio, video and written resources embedded in the eight weeks are
regularly updated with new material, including [Graduate Program Readings][8],
which are updated monthly. To see what has changed on the site recently, see
[What's New][12].There are many other [Resources][39] available on this site,
including recommendations for [Meditation Groups][40] and [Retreat
Centers][41]. If you are interested in deepening your learning through an
instructor-training program, there are many good training centers, some of
which are listed on the [Mindfulness Training Centers][42] page.

I hope this course has been useful and wish you the best on your journey from here!
