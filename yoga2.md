Mindful Yoga 2 (36 min)

**NOTE:** This sequence is guided by Dr. Lynn Rossy, Health Psychologist for the University of Missouri Wellness Program.

Even if you are very experienced in yoga, please be sure to read [ Mindful Yoga][38] before your first time doing this practice._ Mindful Yoga is different than many traditional yoga practices in that there is less of a focus on the exact posture achieved and more focus on body/mind awareness._

&gt; Mindful Yoga 2][40]

**_Special Note for those with physical limitations: _**_If these movements are too challenging, and trying to do them, even with modifications, is painful or harmful, a very gentle but powerful option is to follow [Thich Nhat Hahn's Ten Mindful Movements][41]. This is a 15-minute sequence, so to get 30 minutes of practice, you can go through it twice, or augment it with the parts of the yoga you can do. Another option is to try [**Mindful Yoga 2 with camera emphasis on chair poses][42]**. It is identical to the video for Mindful Yoga 1, except that the camera is focused on another instructor who does all the poses from a chair._

**_Whether or not you have physical limitations, be sure to modify the movements in any way that makes them doable for you. Sensing what is appropriate for you, and modifying the practices accordingly, is mindfulness in itself._**

Below is an audio alternative to the video above. We recommend you view the video at least the first few times to see how the poses are done, but afterwards you may choose to use this audio version:  

&gt; Your browser does not support the audio element.   
  

Once you are comfortable with it, you may choose to do the yoga without guidance at all. Also, you are welcome to download the audio version to another device. It can be accessed directly at [http://palousemindfulness.com/disks/yoga2.mp3][43]

[ ![][45]

It's important to be aware of physical limits and to dwell at their boundary long enough to experience them but it's just as important not to push beyond them...  
  
Instead we are going to be looking deeply into each moment with full acceptance and not trying to force ourselves to be different from how we are right now.
